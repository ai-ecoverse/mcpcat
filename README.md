# mcpcat

A curl for the Model Context Protocol. One command that talks to any MCP server from a shell, and turns any shell command into an MCP server.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.sliccy.ai/mcpcat | sh
```

The same installer from the GitHub release, if the short URL is unreachable:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/mcpcat/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

Options pass through, for example `curl -fsSL https://get.sliccy.ai/mcpcat | sh -s -- --help`.

Or via npm:

```sh
npm install -g @ai-ecoverse/mcpcat
```

mcpcat runs natively on macOS, Linux and Windows (Node ≥ 24), and inside Sliccy Seven as a kernel program, with the same flags, the same output and the same config file in both places. Orphan-free shutdown of stdio server trees in the kernel needs slicc-kernel ≥ 1.74.0; on older kernels only the direct child is signalled. A SIGKILLed mcpcat runs no handler. On slicc-kernel ≥ 1.88.0, mcpcat spawns stdio servers and served commands with a parent death signal (like Linux `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`), so the kernel SIGKILLs each server's process group when mcpcat dies. On older kernels, and on the host, where there is no portable equivalent, servers that exit on stdin EOF (most MCP servers) still stop, but servers that ignore it keep running.

## Releases: certified = latest

Every change that alters what mcpcat ships is certified before it reaches `main`. A pull request that touches `src/`, the build, the dependencies or the release workflows gets mcpcat's cert-review on a pack of its head, and again in the merge queue on the exact tree that lands on `main`; a FAIL blocks the merge. Docs-, test- and CI-only changes skip it as "not behaviour". Each merge to `main` is then released to npm as `latest` in one step by semantic-release, with provenance, so `npm install @ai-ecoverse/mcpcat` and the installer always get certified code. The verdict line is a comment on the pull request and the `cert-review` commit status.
